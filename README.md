### First step - Connect to client to room

Two clients enter the application and receive the welcome view (Image 1), 
Once `drawing_player` creates a room, he will receive the room ID and wait for `guessing_player` at the waiting room (Image 2),
`guessing_player` will join the same room using the room ID.

### Second step - Choose the word and draw

Once both clients join the room, `drawing_player` will choose a word to draw at the word choosing view (Image 3),
meanwhile, `guessing_player` waits for a drawing at the guessing view (Image 4),
at this point `drawing_player` needs to draw the word and send it using the drawing board view (Images 5 & 6).

### Third step - View the draw and submit answer

Once the drawing is received by the server, the option to view the drawing will be enabled (Images 7 & 8), 
the `guessing_player` will submit their answer and the roles will be switched.
 
If the answer is correct the players will gain score according to the difficulty of the chosen word.
